# Notes from 5/26/22

1. The cards in the trello board are like each persons wallet
1. We need to create some type of authentication so that you only see your card. (QR CODE)
1. Pull from a text file that has all the dares and randomly assigns it to each person
1. pre-game it with submitting your own contextual dares
1. we need to save globally who completed what dare
1. (read where this database is getting written to)
